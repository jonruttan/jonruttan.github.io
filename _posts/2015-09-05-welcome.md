Welcome!

It was so kind of you to come! And you are very nice!

Quoting Tweedledee's poem may seem odd, because this is a journal about
computers and development nonsense. It's my warning that this journey serves to
sate the appetites of the walri and carpenters. Contrariwise for oysters;
naïve oysters may be led astray and "I  weep for you, I deeply sympathize."

Wise oysters will wink their eye, shake their heavy head, and choose not to
leave the oyster-bed.
