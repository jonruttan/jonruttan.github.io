> Imagine that you have control of a little creature called a turtle that exists in a mathematical plane or, better yet, on a computer display screen. The turtle can respond to a few simple commands: FORWARD moves the turtle, in the direction it is facing, some number of units. RIGHT rotates it in place, clockwise, some number of degrees. BACK and LEFT cause the opposite movement.

I came across this book: *[Turtle Geometry: The Computer as a Medium for Exploring Mathematics by Harold Abelson and Andrea diSessa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Geometry)*, which describes itself as *"a computer-based introduction to geometry and advanced mathematics at the high school or undergraduate level",* and thought it would be fun to work through it generating the images, and doing the exercises.

I'm implementing it in [Racket](https://racket-lange.org), but the *Turtle Procedure Notation* used in the book is quite easy to adapt to any language.

If you'd like to follow along, there is an open access edition of the book available here: [MIT Press Direct: Turtle Geometry](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/4663/Turtle-GeometryThe-Computer-as-a-Medium-for).
