# Preamble

{% include turtle-geometry/blurb.md %}

I'm implementing it in [Racket](https://racket-lange.org), but the *Turtle Procedure Notation* used in the book is quite easy to adapt to any language.

If you'd like to follow along, there is an open access edition of the book available here: [MIT Press Direct: Turtle Geometry](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/4663/Turtle-GeometryThe-Computer-as-a-Medium-for).

The previous post in this Turtle Geometry series can be found [here]({{ page.previous.url }}).
