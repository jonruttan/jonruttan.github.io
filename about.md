This is Jon Ruttan's online journal for sundry topics regarding computers and software.

I've been a professional software developer for 20 years, and an amateur for 10 years prior to that. I'm equally fascinated by hardware and software, but I chose software for my career, hardware for a hobby. I've always loved taking things apart to see how they work, and if they're broken, fixing them.

I put this site together so I'd have a place to record and share information about the the methods I've employed when working on computer and development problems.
