# About Me

Welcome to my online journal, where I delve into various topics related to computers and software.

# My Journey

With 30 years of professional experience in software development and 10 as an amateur, my passion lies at the intersection of hardware and software. While my career is rooted in software, hardware remains a beloved hobby. I've always enjoyed deconstructing and fixing things to understand their workings.

# Purpose

This site serves as a repository for sharing my methods and insights on tackling computer and development challenges.
